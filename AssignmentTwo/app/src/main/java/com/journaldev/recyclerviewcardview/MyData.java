            "He is hilarious from start to finish\nhe grows and develops as a person and character so much\nhis friendship with Joey is the best friendship of the show, while his relationship with Monica is the best relationship of the show.\n",
            "Rachel can be annoying with her spoilt nature and naivety, but that simply adds to how great of a character she is as she undergoes insane development.\nShe goes from clueless coffee waitress to a successful member of the fashion industry.\n",
            "Joey is an incredible part of the show.\nHis friendship with Chandler is perhaps the highlight of the entire first few seasons\nhe is charming, hilarious, and interesting with his struggling actor career.\n",
            "Ross's little sister Monica is also a pivotal part of the show, and while she is not everybody's cup of tea with her obsessive cleaning and bossiness, she is, unlike her brother, likable a lot of the time.\n",
            "Ross is a crucial part of the show and has some fantastic moments in terms of being absolutely hilarious and serious narrative.\nHe does some awful things, and personality-wise, he can be a total jerk\n",
            "She is amazing a lot of the time, with a slew of iconic moments and quotes, funny stories, and, of course, the surrogacy arc.\nBut, at the same time, Phoebe is also the odd one out of the group.\n",
            "Mike made sure that as the show came to an end that Phoebe got a satisfying conclusion.\nRather than getting pushed to the side with no real direction like Joey, Phoebe managed to get married, with the promise of children in the future.\n",
            "Richard Burke only appears in ten episodes of Friends, yet still makes such a colossal impact on the show, both in terms of the characters, namely Monica, and the fans.\n",
            "Janice is the first true love interest audiences meet in Friends except for Ross's ex-wife and Barry.\nShe continues to pop up for all ten seasons of the show, admittedly with higher quality cameos coming when Chandler is not with Monica.\n",
            "Gunther is the manager of Central Perk, who, outside of the main six, appeared in most episodes of Friends.\n"
